# How to Submit Your Bot

## What to Submit

Submit these **3 files** from your team directory:

1. `YourTeamBot.java` - Your bot source code
2. `YourTeamBot.json` - Bot metadata
3. `YourTeamBot.sh` - Launch script (or .cmd for Windows)

## Before Submitting

### 1. Test Your Bot

```bash
# Navigate to your team directory
cd tank-royale/teams/your-team

# Make script executable
chmod +x YourTeamBot.sh

# Test compilation (will start bot process)
./YourTeamBot.sh
# Press Ctrl+C after a few seconds if it starts without errors
```

### 2. Verify Files

```bash
# Check all 3 files exist
ls YourTeamBot.*

# Should show:
# YourTeamBot.java
# YourTeamBot.json
# YourTeamBot.sh
```

### 3. Check Bot Name

Ensure your bot name is consistent across all files:
- Java class name matches filename
- JSON "name" field is clear and identifies your team
- Launch script references correct filename

## Submission Methods

### Option 1: Git Commit (Preferred)

```bash
# From your team directory
cd tank-royale/teams/your-team

# Stage your files
git add YourTeamBot.java YourTeamBot.json YourTeamBot.sh

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Submit [Team Name] bot for tournament"

# Push to repository
git push
```

### Option 2: File Upload

If hosts provide alternative submission method:

1. Compress your 3 files:
   ```bash
   zip team-name-bot.zip YourTeamBot.*
   ```

2. Upload to designated location (Slack/shared folder/etc.)

3. Confirm with hosts that submission was received
